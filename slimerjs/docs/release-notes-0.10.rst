==============================
Release Notes of SlimerJS 0.10
==============================

version 0.10.0
==============

Still in development

New features
------------

- Experimental support of Webdriver, by using GhostDriver like phantomjs, to control SlimerJS from Selenium.

New API
-------

- ``webpage.render()`` can now generates PDF, BMP and ICO.
- ``webpage.paperSize`` is supported (except its header and footer properties).
- ``webpage.onLongRunningScript`` and ``webpage.stopJavascript()`` to allow to be informed of
   webpage having long running scripts (compatible with Phantomjs 2)
- ``phantom.webdriverMode``

Improvements
------------

- Exit code is now supported with ``slimer.exit()`` and ``phantom.exit()`` (except with slimerjs.bat)
- ``require`` supports node modules (it searches into node_modules directories)
- ``webpage.onConsoleMessage`` can receive additionnal parameters : level, function name and timestamp

Fixed bugs
----------

- Fixed configuration reading for script handlers (internal stuff)
- Callback given to ``webpage.open()`` is now really called after the page loading:
  it allows to call ``render()`` without a delay (``setTimeout``...)

----------------------------------

- a module should be able to call the ``return`` keyword
